I needed a way to track my gun colloection, all the reloading stuff and the data. This is my atempt to to track all this data. The database table layouts are in the base classes. 
if you want to try the program be prepared to setup MySQL or your favorite database program. I'm not writing the scripts for you. This is the 5th atempt but I think I got everything.
The program will generate PDF label which you can print out. I use a simple date based lot system to track factory and reloaded rounds. Chorograh data, reloading dies, and bullet molds
are given a unique number for tracking. Everything can be filtered by fields like year produced or procured, caliber, Maker or other data. I have a search function for lot, serial, or 
unique number. I like the table layout and I'm very proud of the menu system.
